In this scary and hostile context, I will tell you, the invisible and possibly inexistent reader, the strange creatures I stumbled upon and what I could learn from those encounters.</p><p>To keep motivated to this enterprise, I just started the 100 days of code challenge, that consist in get your hands dirty and code for at least one hour per day, for 100 days nonstop, so I will code every day and probably post here a couple of times a week. More details and rules here: <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">https://www.100daysofcode.com/</a></p><p>For that, I dusted off my 7 years old twitter account, I never liked twitter, but I'll give it a chance. Another rusted and forgoten thing is my English, I will write everithing in english for getting used to it, and just in case some foreign company wants to hire me (wink wink).</p><p>That's all for today, i'll try to get this uploaded on  my github so if you are reading this, I succeeded.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
