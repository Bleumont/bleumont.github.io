So, I thought "OK, APIs are interesting and involve most of the stuff I want to dig onto, let's make one".</p><p>With the task defined, sort of, the next question is, what is it for? How will it be used? After a couple of days, I came up with the idea of making an API for serving people, fake people of course. This data surely would come in handy for other future projects and could be a cool tool to have.</p><p>I started defining the person schema, modified it a couple of times and ended with this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code> person: {
        dni,
        name,
        surname,
        birth-date,
        adress: { street, city, postal-code, province },
     }
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>// Dni stands &quot;documento nacional de identidad&quot;, the argentinian citizen's ID.</p>
</blockquote>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>For the storage, I was between mongoDB and MySQL, ended up with the lather for I decided to store 'city' and 'province' as separated entities and I'm more comfortable with dealing with relational data.</p><p>The actual data belongs to public Argentinian <a href="https://datos.gob.ar">datasets</a>. The site has speed limits so I downloaded the data on CSV and JSON files.</p><p>This datasets came with a lot of useless data (for me at least) so I made a Python script to take the fields I was interested on and discard the rest, this caused the data to shrink significantly and to be easy to work with. The script was made in plain Python (it isn't pythonic and is ugly af, so you'll never see it), but I want to refactor it with pandas for speed and readability.</p><p>The data I used for surnames was taken from a file in this <a href="https://github.com/marcboquet/spanish-names">repo</a>, the file contains surnames registered on Spain, I couldn't find a dataset for Latin American surnames, at least not one with the length I needed. The surnames are very similar in both regions, so it should be just fine, the only thing that is left out are the native American names, since it's a Spaniard list, it contains mostly European surnames.</p><p>One more thing I wanted to add for the people's data was a profile image. For this I will take a picture from <a href="https://www.thispersondoesnotexist.com/">this</a> site. It's so cool! I'll not be saving the pictures anywhere; I'll just pass the URL.</p><p>I have a lot of work from now on! I have to polish the schema, create and populate the database, make the actual API, read more for implement things like hateoas, test it, make a simple frontend, more tests... I wanna quit already.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hello world!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>As a new year's resolution I decided to start a blog.</p><p>In here I will [B]log my experiences as I go deep into the dark realms of backend development.

In this scary and hostile context, I will tell you, the invisible and possibly inexistent reader, the strange creatures I stumbled upon and what I could learn from those encounters.</p><p>To keep motivated to this enterprise, I just started the 100 days of code challenge, that consist in get your hands dirty and code for at least one hour per day, for 100 days nonstop, so I will code every day and probably post here a couple of times a week. More details and rules here: <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">https://www.100daysofcode.com/</a></p><p>For that, I dusted off my 7 years old twitter account, I never liked twitter, but I'll give it a chance. Another rusted and forgoten thing is my English, I will write everithing in english for getting used to it, and just in case some foreign company wants to hire me (wink wink).</p><p>That's all for today, i'll try to get this uploaded on  my github so if you are reading this, I succeeded.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
